# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title. We were also asked to identify employees that would be available to participate in a mentorship program 

Results:

1. The title with the most retirement eligible employees is Senior Engineer with 13,651 employees and number two highest is Senior Staff with 12872 that are eligible for retirement

2. There are 1465 employees that would be good candidates for the mentor program based on their age. 

3.  Pewlett Hackard should focus on creating a succession plan for Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineers. This is the group that will be hot hardest by retirement. 

4. The majority of employees that are eligible for a mentorship program will cover the three titles that will be most affected by retirement. 

Summary: 

There are 33,118 employees that are eligible for retirement 

There are not enough employees eligible for the mentor program to cover all of the retiring employees. With 1465 eligible employees each employee would have to menor 22 employees. I don't believe that this would be an effective mentor program and the teacher would be spread to thin
